# Front-End Cloud Book Writer Platform Implementation

## Objective
Develop a React-based platform for creating, editing, and collaborating on books, with an emphasis on an efficient and user-friendly UI.

## Setup and Build Instructions

 - Installation `npm install`
 - Development Server `num run dev`
 - Run Mock Server `npm run server`
 - Build `npm run build`
 - Preview Built Version `npm run preview`
 


## Implementation Overview

### 1. Data Structure & Rendering
- **Flat Data Model**: Used for simplified CRUD operations, ensuring easy updates and management.
  - **Benefits**: Prevents stack overflow issues common in deeply recursive structures, making updates straightforward and debugging easier.
- **Recursive Rendering**: Employed to display nested sections using Reactâ€™s efficient virtual DOM.
  - **Approach**: A utility function builds the hierarchy in memory for rendering, balancing simplicity with performance.

### 2. Authentication & Roles
- **Authentication**: Implemented a basic login system using `json-server-auth` for simulation.
  - **Predefined Users**:
    - **Author**: 
      - **Email**: `meer@demo.com `
      - **Password**: `meer123`
    - **Editor**:
      - **Email**: `neer@demo`
      - **Password**:`neer123`
- **Role Permissions**:
  - **Author**: Can create, update, and delete sections and subsections.
  - **Editor**: Limited to updating sections only.

### 3. Core Components
- **`SimpleSection.jsx`**: A minimal component for rendering the viewable hierarchy.
- **`Section.jsx`**: Handles interactive data management, including creating, updating, and deleting sections.
- **`Editor.jsx`**: A protected component that allows editing actions after authentication.

### 4. Authentication Flow
- **Protected Routes**: The `Editor` component is only accessible after login, ensuring secure and role-based access control.
- **User Roles**: Managed with checks to enforce permissions.

## Key Trade-offs & Decisions
- **Flat vs. Recursive**: Opted for a flat data model to simplify updates, with recursive rendering for a performant, memory-efficient display.
- **Performance Considerations**: The in-memory hierarchy builder and React's virtual DOM ensure efficient rendering.
- **Simplified Authentication**: Focused on core role-based checks using `json-server-auth`.

### Notes & Future Scope
- **Potential Improvements**: 
  - Adding caching mechanisms and testing (e.g., with Jest) to boost performance and reliability.
  - Using virtualization libraries like `react-window` to optimize large datasets by rendering only visible sections in DOM.

This structured implementation covers essential functionality while leaving room for future enhancements.
